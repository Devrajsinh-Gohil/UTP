- **EXTRACT**: By interfacing with Database, itâ€™s schema is extracted and forwarded to LLM. The interfacing can be done Python, C++, Java etc.
- **ANALYZE**: The input schema is then analyzed by LLM to understand the structure of data in database.
- **GENERATE**: After analyzing the data LLM is then provided a  request in Natural Language which has the requirements of Hiring Organization. The LLM Generates the Query according to the request and structure of database.
- **FETCH**: The Query is then fired to database via database interface and the result is received from the database.
- **FILTER**: The result is then given to LLM for better filtering and matching the most suitable candidates according to the requirement of Organization.
- **FORMAT**: After filtering LLM will format the data according to the file format as per the requirement of the platform.

- **TECH STACK**: Azure OpenAI (gpt-35-turbo) for LLM, AzureMachine Learning for using Prompt Flow service and Deployment,Python for interacting with API and Streamlit package to run the User Interface.
- **INPUT**: User requirement in Natural Language.
- **DATA** (PYTHON): Due to resource and storage constraints, a dummy dataset in form of python dictionary is used.
- **GET CANDIDATES** (LLM): filters candidate according to the user input and formats JSON output.
- **GET JSON** (LLM): The output of GET CANDIDATES is then corrected if anomalies are present and the output assures output is syntactically correct.
- **OUTPUT**: The output contains the JSON format containing the data of candidates according to the request and sent to User Interface via API deployed.
